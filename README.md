# SBGAT-BOT

The SBGAT-BOT is a Python tool designed to create graphical representations of scientific experiments. It extracts data from PDFs of experimental studies and generates visual summaries of the data. The project aims to simplify the interpretation of scientific results and integrate visual analytics into machine learning workflows.

## Features

- Extracts JSON data from PDFs of experimental studies.
- Creates clear and informative visualizations representing the experimental data.
- Intended for integration with machine learning models to automate the extraction and visualization process.

## Background

NASA Ames Research Center, in collaboration with the Open Data Science community, has been at the forefront of applying machine learning to extract meaningful insights from vast amounts of research data. The SBGAT-BOT is a contribution to this endeavor, promising to streamline the process of data to decision-making in research environments.

### Usage

After setting up the project, you can run the script visualizer.py to start generating visualizations from your data.
```
from visualizer import create_visualization

# Example data input
data = { ... }

create_visualization(data)
```
